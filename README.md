# sudokuSolver

The provided Java code implements a Sudoku solver using a backtracking algorithm. The program defines a sudokuSolver class with methods to check the validity of placing a number in a particular cell based on Sudoku rules. The main method initializes a Sudoku board with a partially filled puzzle, attempts to solve it using the implemented algorithm, and prints the solved board or indicates failure.

The solver employs three conditions (row, column, and box) to ensure that a number can be legally placed in a given cell. The recursive solve method iterates through the board, attempting to fill empty cells with valid numbers. If a solution is found, it prints the solved Sudoku board; otherwise, it returns false.

The program provides a console-based interface for solving Sudoku puzzles and serves as a practical example of a backtracking algorithm for solving constraint satisfaction problems.
