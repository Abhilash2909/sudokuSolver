# sudokuSolver

This Java project, SudokuSolver, offers a backtracking-based solution for solving Sudoku puzzles. The program validates input Sudoku boards, ensuring adherence to Sudoku rules, and employs a recursive algorithm to systematically fill empty cells until a solution is found. The project includes methods for input validation, error handling, and a user-friendly console interface for displaying solved Sudoku boards. Aiming for simplicity and readability, this solver serves as an educational example of backtracking algorithms applied to constraint satisfaction problems.
